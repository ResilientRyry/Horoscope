## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

  I used some css for the coloring for some basic styele. I used javascript with conditionals to post the correct information and a click event to gather the information. It starts with a user selecting a day and month and then clicking a button and a horoscope(from an older date) will appear.

## Lessons Learned:
  Begining stages of being able to show information that a User is specifically looking for.
